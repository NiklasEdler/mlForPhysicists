Machine Learning For Physicists

These notebooks have been put together as part of a "Machine Learning for Physicists" course for UCL Physics and Astronomy students that will run for the first time in the Autumn term 2020.

Some of the examples in this course were heavily inspired by the https://machine-learning-for-physicists.org course that has been run a few times by Florian Marquardt.
